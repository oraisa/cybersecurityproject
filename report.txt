1. Outdated dependencies
    - all dependencies use old version
2. XSS
    - name and address fields can be used to input javascript
3. Security misconfiguration allowing CSRF
    - deleting signups is possible through CSRF
4. Broken access control
    - everyone can view the signups page
5. Broken authentication
    - account name admin, password admin

Issue: XSS
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/form
2. Enter hello into the name field
3. Enter world<script>alert("Hello world");</script> to the address field
4. Go to http://localhost:8080/login
5. Log in (username: ted, password: carrots)
6. Go to http://localhost:8080/signups
7. See the alert box the injected javascript opened

How to fix:
The fix is simple. Change both instances of th:utext to th:text in the
signups.html template. th:text escapes html tags, so the attempted XSS string
would be displayed as it was entered.

Issue: Broken access control (anyone can see signups)
1. Ensure you are not logged in (logout by going to http://localhost:8080/logout)
2. Go to http://localhost:8080/signups
3. You can see the page even though you are not logged in

How to fix:
In SecurityConfiguration.java, only urls matching /signups/delete/* require
authentication, meaning that only deleting signups requires authentication.
This should be changed to /signups*, meaning that seeing and deleting signups
requires authentication.
